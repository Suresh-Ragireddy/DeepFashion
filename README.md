# DeepFashion: Generative Adversarial Networks for Fashion Product Generation

Welcome to **DeepFashion**, a deep learning project designed to generate fashion product images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that trains a DCGAN model in PyTorch.

## Project Overview

GANs are a powerful class of neural networks used for generating synthetic data that resembles a given training dataset. In this project, we utilize GANs to create unique fashion product images. The project is built on the DCGAN architecture, which is particularly effective in generating high-quality images.

## Dataset

We use the [Fashion Product Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small) for training our model. The dataset contains thousands of fashion product images across various categories. You can download the dataset directly using the provided code or manually from Kaggle.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Run Using Free Online Resources (Recommended)

You can run the notebook on cloud platforms without any setup:

- **Google Colab**: Click the "Run on Colab" button in the notebook to start training on Google’s cloud platform.
- **Binder**: Although Binder doesn’t support GPUs, it allows you to run the code without any setup.
- **Kaggle**: You can also run the notebook on Kaggle, which provides free GPU support.

### 2. Run Locally on Your Computer

If you prefer running the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Set up Python and install the required libraries.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suresh-ragireddy/DeepFashion.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DeepFashion
4. Install dependencies (you may need to uncomment and run the appropriate command for your OS in the notebook):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DeepFashion.ipynb

### Using a GPU for Faster Training

To accelerate training, you can use a GPU. Here’s how to enable it on different platforms:

- **Google Colab**: Go to "Runtime > Change Runtime Type" and select "GPU."
- **Kaggle**: Enable the GPU in the "Settings" tab.
- **Local (Linux/Windows)**: Make sure you have [NVIDIA CUDA drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) installed.

## Model Architecture

Our model is based on the DCGAN architecture, which is well-suited for generating realistic images:

- **Generator**: Creates "fake" fashion product images from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: Differentiates between "real" fashion product images from the dataset and "fake" images generated by the model.

The model alternates between training the discriminator and the generator, gradually improving the quality of the generated images.

## Results

We can also visualize how the loss changes over time. Visualizing losses is quite useful for debugging the training process. For GANs, we expect the generator's loss to reduce over time, without the discriminator's loss getting too high.

- **Generator Loss**: The lowest loss achieved by the generator is `0.0035`.
- **Discriminator Loss**: The discriminator's loss is `0.9453`, which is approximately `94.53%`.

Here are some examples of images produced by our model:
